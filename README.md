- **Internal Memory Modules:**
  - **Flash Memory (IC Flash):** Provides additional storage for firmware or data logging.
  - **EEPROM:** Non-volatile memory for storing configuration or small datasets.
  - **SRAM:** Volatile memory for high-speed temporary data storage.
- **Power Management:** Efficient power regulation and distribution with voltage regulators.
- **Port Headers:** Standard Arduino Uno-compatible pin headers for connectivity.

## Schematic Description
### ATmega16U2 Controller
This section handles USB-to-serial communication, enabling the uploading of sketches and serial data exchange. Key components include:
- Crystal oscillator for clock signal.
- USB Type-C interface for modern connectivity.

### ATmega328P Microcontroller
The main processing unit for running Arduino sketches. Connected to the required external components such as:
- Reset circuitry.
- Power supply connections.
- I/O port headers.

### Memory Management
Includes three types of memory modules:
1. **IC Flash Memory:** High-capacity storage for firmware.
2. **EEPROM IC:** Stores persistent data that remains intact after power loss.
3. **SRAM IC:** High-speed temporary data storage for applications requiring fast access.

### Power Management
The power management circuit provides stable 5V and 3.3V supplies to the components. It includes:
- Linear voltage regulators.
- Input power options (DC-IN and USB).
- Power indicator LED.

### USB Type-C Interface
Supports USB power delivery and communication. It includes ESD protection and ensures reliable connections.

### Port Headers
Arduino-compatible headers for interfacing with external modules and shields.

### Reset Button
Allows manual resetting of the microcontroller during operation or programming.
